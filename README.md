## Project Title: Predictive Modeling & EDA with Text Data

### Project Overview

This project focuses on predictive modeling using a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature extraction from cleaned textual data (tweets). The project involves:

Cleaning and processing text data.
Creating feature vectors from textual data using techniques such as Bag of Words (BOW).
Performing EDA to understand the relationships between numeric features.
Training machine learning models to make predictions and evaluate performance.
Visualizing important correlations between variables in the dataset using heatmaps.

### Project Structure

Jupyter Notebooks: The analysis and modeling are conducted in a Jupyter notebook (Task-1.ipynb).
Data Processing: The project involves cleaning tweets and feature extraction using CountVectorizer.
Visualizations: Includes heatmaps for visualizing the correlations between numerical variables in the dataset.

### Key Steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Load the dataset and perform data cleaning, especially focusing on tweets.
Extract important features from cleaned text data using CountVectorizer.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct a detailed EDA, including visualizations like heatmaps to explore the relationships between various features.

Predictive Modeling:
Train a predictive model (e.g., logistic regression or another machine learning model) using feature vectors from textual data.
Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization:
Visualize the correlation between numeric features in the dataset using a heatmap.

### Technologies Used

Python: Main programming language for the analysis.
Libraries:
scikit-learn: For feature extraction and machine learning models.
pandas: Data manipulation and processing.
numpy: Numerical computing.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
wordcloud: For generating word clouds (optional, install if needed).
